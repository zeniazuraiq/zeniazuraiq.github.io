  title={Massive neutron stars as mass gap candidates: Exploring equation of state and magnetic field},
  author={Zuraiq, Zenia and Mukhopadhyay, Banibrata and Weber, Fridolin},
  abstract={The densities in the cores of the neutron stars (NSs) can reach several times that of the nuclear saturation density. The exact nature of matter at these densities is still virtually unknown. We consider a number of proposed, phenomenological relativistic mean-field equations of state to construct theoretical models of NSs. We find that the emergence of exotic matter at these high densities restricts the mass of NSs to ≃ 2.2M⊙. However, the presence of magnetic fields and a model anisotropy significantly increases the star's mass, placing it within the observational mass gap that separates the heaviest NSs from the lightest black holes. Therefore, we propose that gravitational wave observations, like GW190814, and other potential candidates within this mass gap, may actually represent massive, magnetized NSs.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
