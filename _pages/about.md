Hi! I am Zenia Zuraiq, a Ph.D. student and [Prime Minister's Research Fellow](https://www.pmrf.in/) at the [Department of Physics](http://www.physics.iisc.ernet.in/), IISc Bangalore. 

I work in theoretical/high energy astrophysics. More specifically, I study the compact objects formed at the end stages of a star's life, focussing on the exotic [neutron stars](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Neutron_star) and [white dwarfs](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/White_dwarf).
