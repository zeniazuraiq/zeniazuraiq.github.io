Hi! I am Zenia Zuraiq, a Ph.D. student and [Prime Minister's Research Fellow](https://www.pmrf.in/) at the [Department of Physics](http://www.physics.iisc.ernet.in/), IISc Bangalore. 

I work in theoretical/high energy astrophysics. More specifically, I study the [compact objects](https://zeniazuraiq.github.io/projects/) formed at the end stages of a star's life, focussing on neutron stars and white dwarfs.
